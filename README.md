# LLM-From-Scratch
<br>

This is a Python Project which gives a high level overview of creating a Large Language Model from scratch.
<br>
This project includes the code for the math, data handling as well as the Transformer architecture required to create a LLM from scratch.
<br><br>
This project could not have been possible without the excellent tutorials provided by freeCodeCamp.org and Andrej Karpathy. All resources used will be listed below.
